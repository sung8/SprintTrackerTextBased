# Sprint Tracker Application

I. What are the current problems? 
Effective agile project management is crucial for success, but current tools often have limited features or lock key functionality behind paywalls. Juggling multiple tools to get views needed for agile can hinder teams. Developers face obstacles like code conflicts, inconsistent workflows, integration issues, and dependency problems. These roadblocks are challenging to resolve, slowing overall productivity. Software engineering inherently involves navigating such obstacles. The tool integrates sprint planning, task tracking, and issue management. This consolidated view aims to smooth agile development, helping teams coordinate, track blockers, and resolve issues faster.

I. What problems are solved? 
The tool consolidates sprint planning and issue tracking, enabling agile teams to coordinate efficiently. Users can break down tasks hierarchically and assign priority levels while logging any blocking issues. Users can also log any blocking issues like bugs, conflicts, or bottlenecks to specific tasks, then alert teammates based on task assignment. Within the 2-week sprint timeline, our integrated planner allows task decomposition, priority tracking, management, and targeted notifications to resolve issues faster. Team members assigned to a task can add issues and alert relevant colleagues. Configurable workflows and permissions accommodate different team dynamics and processes. By combining task order visualization, priority tracking, planning, and actionable alerts, our tool aims to optimize agile collaboration.
